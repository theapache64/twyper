## ⌨️ Usage

![latestVersion](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/theapache64/twyper)

### 1. Add dependency
```groovy
repositories {
  maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // Add jitpack
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.theapache64:twyper:<latest.version>'
}
```

### 2. Use `Twyper` composable

```kotlin
val items = remember { mutableStateListOf(*('A'..'Z').toList().toTypedArray()) }

//  twyperController to swipe cards programmatically
val twyperController = rememberTwyperController() 
Twyper(
    items = items,
    twyperController = twyperController, // optional
    onItemRemoved = { item, direction ->
        println("Item removed: $item -> $direction")
        items.remove(item)
    },
    onEmpty = { // invoked when all stack is empty
        println("End reached")
    }
) { item ->
    // card content goes here
}

```
